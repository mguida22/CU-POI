# University of Colorado Points of Interest

CU POI is an interactive map for the University of Colorado Boulder. The aim is to improve experience compared to the [campus map](http://www.colorado.edu/campusmap/) that CU provides. This includes proper display on mobile platforms, search functionality and fluid scrolling.

> This project is currently a work in progress

##TODO
- Host online (github, heroku, others...?)
- Add the rest of the data points for CU
- Rename
- Write instructions for use
- Fix support for JSON (may just remove for now)
- Split project into api and website
