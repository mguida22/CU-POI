# CU Campus Map

## Future

This is a v1 of the map project. There are a lot of improvements to be made and it could really use a better structure along with some test coverage. 

To improve upon this, the functionality of this is being moved to [mguida22/cu-poi-server](https://github.com/mguida22/cu-poi-server) where it can be accessed as an api.

Eventually this will turn into a site that simply makes requests to the server and displays the results.

## About

A live preview is available at [mguida22.github.io/cu-poi](http://mguida22.github.io/cu-poi/).

CU Campus Map is an interactive map for the University of Colorado Boulder. The aim is to improve experience compared to the [campus map](http://www.colorado.edu/campusmap/) that CU provides. This includes proper display on mobile platforms, search functionality and fluid scrolling.
