CU Campus Map is an interactive map for the University of Colorado Boulder. The aim is to improve experience compared to the [campus map](http://www.colorado.edu/campusmap/) that CU provides. This includes proper display on mobile platforms, search functionality and fluid scrolling.

##TODO
- Write instructions for use
- Fix support for JSON (may just remove for now)
- Split project into api and website
